Creates a microbot object from the movie Big Hero 6. 
The object is created by calling the createMicrobot() function and 
is returned as an object container that can be scaled and 
repositioned in your scene as needed. The function takes in a mesh
material to map onto the object's surface so it can be
changed as desired, although in the movie it has a black/metalic.

BOUNDING BOX FOR JUST MICROBOT
	LEFT TO RIGHT: 3 + 2 - 0.5 + 3.5 + 2 - 0.5 + 3.5 = 13
	TOP TO BOTTOM: 3
	FRONT TO BACK: 3
