/*
A THREE.js model of Yokai (from Big Hero 6). Copyright (Â©) 2015 by JENNIFER CHIEN This program is released under the LICENCE INFO HERE.

Title: yokai.js
Author: Jennifer Chien
CREATED: Dec 1, 2016
MODIFIED:
Purpose: CS 307 Contribution Library
Creates the Yokai (villain) character from the movie Big Hero 6. 
(he kind of looks like no-face from spirited away)
The character created by calling the createYokai() function 
is returned in an object container that can be scaled and 
repositioned in your scene as needed. The default 
THREE.MeshPhongMaterial() was used in coloring Yokai, although
he is normally completely black, easily changed by adjusting the 
defaultMesh variable in jcYokaiParams.

PLACEMENT NOTE: BY DEFAULT YOKAI IS FACING TO THE LEFT

BOUNDING BOX FOR YOKAI
	LEFT TO RIGHT: 26 (at the bottom), 14 at the top
	TOP TO BOTTOM: 39, -60
	FRONT TO BACK: 26 (at the bottom), 14 at the top
